# Functions

There are many fuctions in this simulator. You can use these functions to tweak the settings and make awesome simulations!!

## List of Functions

accessVelocity : this function allows you to change the velocity of your object.

accessAccelleration : this function allows you to change the accelleration of the object.

accessTopspped : this function allows you to change the topspeed of your object.

accessMass : this function allows you to change the mass of your object.

applyForce : this function applies force to your object. You can use this to model gravity and wind.

update : this function updates the position of the object.

display : displayes your object (you can choose how want to display your object).

checkEdges : Check edges but allows objects to move freely across the boundaries and come back.

checkEdges1 : Check edges but allows objects to only be inside the boundaries.
