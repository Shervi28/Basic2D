# Setup

1. First you need to install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/). 
> NOTE: Basic2D is only available for Processing(Java).

2. You need to clone this GitHub repo with the following command:
```
  git clone https://github.com/Shervi28/Basic2D.git
```
> NOTE: You could also download this repo as a .zip and you can put the downloaded repo anywhere in your machine.

3. Next create a folder called sims inside of the main folder.

4. Now inside of this folder you can create a new processing sketch and get started!
