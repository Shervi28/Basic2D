# Basic2D
This is a very basic 2D physics engine. Right now, its capable of doing basic physics simulations, hence thats why its called basic2D.

## Capabilities 

* Basic physics simulations 
  * Force, acceleration, velocity and etc.
  
### Coming soon...
* Gravity, friction, air and fluid resistance
* Attraction

> NOTE: Basic2D is currently only available for processing(java).

I have wrote examples for Basic2D to show how to work with it.
