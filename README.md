# Basic2D
This is a very basic 2D physics engine. Right now, its capable of doing basic physics simulations, hence thats why its called basic2D.

## Capabilities 
* Basic physics simulations 
  * Force, acceleration, velocity and etc.
  
### Coming soon...
* Gravity, friction, air and fluid resistance
* Attraction

> NOTE: Basic2D is currently only available for processing(java).

I have wrote examples for Basic2D to show how to work with it.

## How Basic2D works
Basic2D has two parts; the object and the main file. You can edit some of the code of the object according to your needs. Then you can use your main file to run the program.
